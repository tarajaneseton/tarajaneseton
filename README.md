### Hey :wave:

I'm Tara, a London-based software developer, nature-lover and Hip Hop fan.

:computer: I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.

:memo: Right now, I'm working on creating my portfolio page.

:two_hearts: My hobbies include writing (code and words), activism, cooking, DJing and being in nature.

⚡ Fun fact: Previously I worked in the start-up world as a social media manager where I created content for the likes of Björk, Lovebox and that yellow mattress company.
